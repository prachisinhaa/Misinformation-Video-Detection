# Misinformation-Video-Detection
Final project for the Computer Vision course 2024

### Step 1: 
Downloading and downsampling the data.

### Step 2: 
Preprocessing data: converting the annotation file URLs into an image dataset constisting of youtube video thumbnails.

### Step 3: 
Image resize: Resizing all the thumbnail images to a unifrom 320x320.

### Step 4: 
Dataset cleaning: filtered only relevant attributes from the csv file. Reduced the thumbnail dataset samples to match the filtered annotations.

### Step 5:
Linear Classifier: implemented LogisticRegression model using sklearn.

### Step 6:
Nerual Network: implemented basic and complex NN model using Tensorflow.  

### Step 7: 
CNN: implemented CNN models with and without regularisation. Also implemented pretrained VGG16 and resnet models.
